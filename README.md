## **Objective**
The objective of the project is using algorithm to help investors analyze thousands of available loans at Leanding Club. 

(Lending Club is America's #1 credit marketplace where customers apply for a low, fixed rate personal loan or invest to earn solid returns. [https://www.lendingclub.com/](https://www.lendingclub.com/))

## **Centerpiece**
The algorithm used is Gradient Boosted Regression Trees(CBRT). The advantages of CBRT are: natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features), predictive power, robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions). 

The procedure involves preprocessing 1,320,000+ samples and filtering 100+ features. 

The top five key features picked according to the feature-importance scores are: debt-to-income ratio, annual income, total installment high credit/credit limit, revolving credit limit and portion of balances.
